> Hi, this is my personal blog where i write about my project, nonsense and useless ideas. I love programming because it reminds me when i was a kid, joining lego bricks. In my free time i read generally SciFi, listen to music and play computer games, my other passions. At the moment i’m trying to improve and develop my skills. I’m available for freelance project so don’t be scared of getting in touch with me.
